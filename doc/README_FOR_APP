= Welcome to Zena

Zena is a CMS. (c) teti.ch 2007

-------------------------------------------
== Todo
=== Tools
=== Optimization & Cache
* sweep public page cache :
  * page for all lang
  * project for all lang
* on destroy : remove all (including document files)
=== Optimization & Cache
* users, groups see all TODO: test...  
-------------------------------------------
== Enhancements
=== Views
* split zen.css, admin.css, comments.css into
  * actions.css  <== small buttons and stuff (should never be changed)
  * admin.css    <== administration boxes
  * zen.css      <== layout style
  * comments.css <== comment style
* view archive... & search tool
* contact search/list page
=== Security
* How do we avoid someone removing the wiki as a whole ? +can_destroy+ will have to look for publish access in the parent.
* Implement salt login with client side JS : http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5/
=== Error messages
* translate flash 'notice' and 'error', with clever '%s'. Translate error messages (message and field name)
=== Preferences, ZENA_ENV
Store user defaults, prefs and site config, etc in the database. STI starting with 'settings' (id, key(string), value(yaml), type) :
* settings <--- UserPreferences
* settings <--- ProjectSettings
* settings <--- SiteConfiguration
=== Translations
* load new languages from the web interface

Custom info that could be stored
* custom menu = std menu + own menu (= user[:custom_menu_collector])
* default comment_group

=== Other
* is +text+ a good format for *paths* ? What should be the size of a string ?
-------------------------------------------
== general info
* when creating the database: "create database zena DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COLLATE=utf8_general_ci;"

= Conception
Zena is divided into modules. These modules are :
== web (base engine)
Content management system. The web module can contain different nodes 
* *Contacts* people with addresses
* *Logs* weblog
* *Events* time related events shown in a calendar or as a 'news' list
* *Pages* just normal html content
* *Documents* files, photos, videos, anything up/downloadable
* *Tags* special pages collecting information from other pages
* *Projects* basic place into which the other modules can plug in.
=== calendar component
Provides views and filters for #Events.
=== menu component
Monitor readings, book collection
Provides navigation through #StructuredNodes
=== book component
== book engine
Monitor readings, book collection. It makes it very easy to add book references to documents. Or
just a list of the books the person is reading.
== login engine
* will first implement this in web...
== task engine
Task management (something like trac). This module will help solve questions such as
* who does what
* what has already been done
* take care of new problems, tasks, bugs
* make a like with versioning systems (Subversion)
* milestones
* project progression, planning
* actions done can have a duration thus permitting time invoices
== accounting engine
Accounting user oriented.
* All seizure of monetary flows are done through budget envelopes
* It is trivial to enter things like 'John gave 100.- to Cecilia in advance for the costumes of our next play'
* Monitoring of budget and actual expenses is easy and intuitive
* There is a 1 clic production of legal documents.
