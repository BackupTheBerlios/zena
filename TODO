== Parts that need an urgent cleanup ==

Some parts of zena have become really messy and need an URGENT cleanup. These parts are mostly
related to nested attributes and the cleanup should be made during the move to rails 2.3+.

Some really ugly parts:

=== links ===

We support many different ways to alter links and it's becoming hard to maintain:

node[hot_id] = ZIP
node[link][hot][other_id] = ZIP
node[link][1][other_id] = ZIP along with node[link][1][role] = 'hot'
link[other_id]  = ZIP
link[other_zip] = ZIP

We need 'other_zip' because select_id helper needs to read the value... "select_id" is really bad code. yuk.

===== documentation ======

using negative ids to remove links:

friend_id = -ZIP  ====> ensure there is no 'friend' relationship with node ZIP.
