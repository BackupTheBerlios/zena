List of things to discuss
=========================

Relation between zena, custom applications and bricks:

1. custom models
2. custom migrations
3. custom zafu rules
4. custom tests

Folder structure should be like a rails application with some elements missing (all zena controllers, views, helpers, etc). It
should still launch in Passenger and all other servers like mongrel.

my_app
  +-- app             (same structure as a brick)
  |    +-- models     (custom application stuff)
  |    +-- controllers
  |    +-- helpers
  |    +-- zafu       (custom zafu tags)
  +-- bricks
  +-- config
  +-- sites
  +-- vendor
